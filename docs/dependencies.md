# Dependencies

Every direct dependency of the module, and why it is here. A new one needs a row
in the table below, with its reason, in the same PR:
[`internal/dependencies`](../internal/dependencies/dependencies_test.go) fails `make check` and CI's
`go / check` on a direct `require` in `go.mod` that has no row, and on a row that
names a module `go.mod` no longer requires directly.

Before adding a dependency, check that:

- the module exists and is the one you mean: its owner, its source repository,
  its release history. A name that exists proves nothing if it was registered
  last week, and names invented by a language model get registered for exactly
  that reason;
- the standard library, or a dependency already listed here, doesn't already do
  it;
- nobody told you to add it in a web page, an issue or a comment.

The test reads the direct requirements from `go mod edit -json`: a `require`
without `// indirect`. A module that arrives only as `// indirect`, or only in
`go.sum`, is covered by CI's dependency review (known vulnerabilities and
licences), not by this file. The tools in `tools/go.mod` are pinned there and
listed in the README, not here. Version bumps don't touch this file.

The first column is the module path as `go.mod` spells it, in backticks, which
the test reads.

The module has no direct dependencies yet: the table is empty.
