# Logbook

The store for Those Who Run v2: it subscribes to the bus and writes
sessions and laps to the data volume it owns.
It is the only writer on that volume, and everything else reads through
its services ([ADR 0003](https://github.com/those-who-run/paddock/blob/main/docs/adr/0003-the-store.md) in paddock).

Issues are off in this repository. Every issue, the roadmap and the decisions
(ADRs) live in [those-who-run/paddock](https://github.com/those-who-run/paddock). A pull request here
names its paddock issue: `Closes those-who-run/paddock#N.` when it meets every
acceptance criterion, `Part of those-who-run/paddock#N` otherwise
([`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)).

## Checks

`make check` runs what CI runs; [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) says what that is and
what a new clone runs first.

## Conventions

The ones every Go component shares, from the
[`chassis`](https://github.com/those-who-run/chassis) template:

- **Configuration from the environment**, read once at start-up into a typed
  struct; an unset variable takes its default and a value that can't be read
  stops the process. The example reads `ADDR` (`:8080`) and
  `LOG_LEVEL` (`info`).
- **Logging with `log/slog`, as JSON** on standard output, one object per line,
  with key-value pairs.
- **A health endpoint**, `GET /healthz`, which answers 200 while the process can
  serve.

## From the template

This repository was made from `chassis` with `copier copy`, and
`.copier-answers.yml` records the release it came from and the answers given.
Renovate proposes each new `chassis` release as a PR that runs
`copier update`; chassis's README has the rest.

## Releases

Merging the release PR tags `vX.Y.Z`, and the release workflow publishes
`ghcr.io/those-who-run/twr-logbook:X.Y.Z` once the maintainer approves it in
the `release` environment.
